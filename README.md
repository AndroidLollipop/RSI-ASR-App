## Callbags
This app has been refactored to use callbags instead of a massively messy adhoc architecture.
## About
This is an application created for an RSI project.  
At the moment, this project doesn't use any iOS-specific components and should work on Android.

## Note on pathing
You need to generate the convex regions for the store map used to ensure optimality.  
Also, there are some blind spots in the current map where the path generated is slightly suboptimal.
